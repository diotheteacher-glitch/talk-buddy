English GPT Session API

This repository provides a tiny serverless API endpoint that powers a Custom GPT Action.
The GPT Action shows users clickable options (gender, age group, English level, voice, topic, and conversation mode) and sends them here.
The endpoint simply echoes back the chosen options so the GPT can start the English speaking session.
